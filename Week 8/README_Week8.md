**Course:** CST1510 - CW2 - Multi-Domain Intelligence Platform  

##  Project Overview

The **Intelligence Platform** is a multi-domain data processing system that supports:

* **Cybersecurity incidents management**
* **Dataset metadata cataloging**
* **IT ticket processing**
* **User authentication & role assignment**

This project upgrades the Week 7 text‑file system into a full **database‑driven intelligence engine** with:

* A unified **SQLite relational database**
* Automated **data ingestion** from CSV datasets
* **CRUD operations** across all three intelligence domains

##  Purpose of the Project

Modern intelligence platforms need to process diverse data sources reliably. This Week 8 project demonstrates:

### Handling multiple data domains

The platform brings together three real-world operational areas:

1. **Cyber Incidents** — Managing threats, severity, and status tracking
2. **Datasets Metadata** — Cataloging datasets used by analysts
3. **IT Tickets** — Tracking technical issues within an organization
